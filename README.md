# GraalVM Labs & Tutorials

This repository contains content to get you started working with GraalVM. Within it, we have a number of labs & tutorials
that will guide you through getting started with and using GraalVM. We also have labs that will deep-dive into particular 
topics, such as how reflection and Class loading works within GraalVM Native Image.

This repository is constantly be developed and new labs & tutorials will be added regularly. Please check in regularly
to keep up-to date with what is going on.

To find out more about GraalVM, check out the projects website at, [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/workshops.git). 

## Using these Labs & Tutorials

All of these labs are written so that they will work on your own device (laptop, server). Each lab starts with a set of
prerequisites that state what you will need to have installed in order to run the lab. Please make sure you read these.

First, clone this repository locally:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/workshops.git
```

Open a terminal, change directory to the lab / tutorial you want to try out. Read the `README.md file `
The labs are organised into folders as follows:

* `native-image` : This collects all labs related to GraalVM Native Image

We will add more folders as we add more content - we plan to add more labs relating to `ntive-image`, `polyglot` and
GraalVM as a Java runtime.
